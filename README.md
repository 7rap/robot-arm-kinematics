# 🦾 robot-arm-kinematics - Solve Robot Arm Movements Easily

## 🛠️ Introduction

Welcome to **robot-arm-kinematics**! This project solves forward and inverse robot arm kinematics using ROS2 and RViz. It’s an educational tool developed for students at the Moscow State University of Technology "Stankin." Whether you're exploring robotics or enhancing your understanding, this application helps visualize and calculate the movements of robotic arms.

## 📋 Features

- **Forward Kinematics**: Understand how the arm moves based on joint angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Determine the required angles to reach a specific position.
- **User-Friendly Visualization**: Use RViz to see real-time simulations.
- **Python Integration**: Leverage Python scripts for customizable solutions.
- **Support for URDF**: Import robot models easily for effective testing.

## 📝 User Guide

### 🔍 Understanding the Interface

Once the application is open, familiarize yourself with the interface:

- **Main Menu**: Access features like Forward Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics, and model imports from here.
- **Input Section**: Enter values such as joint angles or end-effector positions.
- **Visualization Panel**: Watch the robotic arm simulate movements based on your inputs.

### 📊 Running Calculations

1. For **Forward Kinematics**:
   - Select the Forward Kinematics option from the main menu.
   - Input the joint angles into the designated fields.
   - Click the "Calculate" button to see the resulting end-effector position.

2. For **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Navigate to the Inverse Kinematics section.
   - Enter the desired end-effector position.
   - Click "Calculate" to find the required joint angles.

The results will appear in the visualization panel, allowing you to see the movement in real-time.
